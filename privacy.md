## Privacy Policy
Your privacy is critically important to us. At Chameleoid we have a few fundamental principles:

- We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
  (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or
  income level for no apparent reason.)
- We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply
  with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
- We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for
  the on-going operation of one of our services.
- In our products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control
  what's visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and
  permanently deleted.

Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals: (Note, the following
privacy policy is available under a [Creative Commons Sharealike][CC] license,
and should seem familiar to you if you've read [Automattic's][Automattic]

### Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Chameleoid collects non-personally-identifying
information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available,
such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and
time of each visitor request. Chameleoid's purpose in collecting non-personally
identifying information is to better understand how Chameleoid's visitors use
its website. From time to time, Chameleoid may release
non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a
report on trends in the usage of its website.

Chameleoid also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Chameleoid only discloses
logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and
discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Chameleoid's websites choose to interact with Chameleoid in
ways that require Chameleoid to gather personally-identifying information. The
amount and type of information that Chameleoid gathers depends on the nature of
the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for some of our
services to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in
transactions with Chameleoid are asked to provide additional information,
including as necessary the personal and financial information required to
process those transactions. In each case, Chameleoid collects such information
only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the
visitor's interaction with Chameleoid. Chameleoid does not disclose
personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors
can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat
that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics
Chameleoid may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
websites. Chameleoid may display this information publicly or provide it to
others. However, Chameleoid does not disclose personally-identifying information
other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Chameleoid discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors
and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to
process it on Chameleoid's behalf or to provide services available at
Chameleoid's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.
Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located
outside of your home country; by using Chameleoid's websites, you consent to the
transfer of such information to them. Chameleoid will not rent or sell
potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to
anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations,
as described above, Chameleoid discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order
or other governmental request, or when Chameleoid believes in good faith that
disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of
Chameleoid, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user
of an Chameleoid website and have supplied your email address, Chameleoid may
occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your
feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Chameleoid and
our products. We primarily use our various product forums and blogs to
communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to
a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one
of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help
us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
Chameleoid takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the
unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's
computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the
visitor returns. Chameleoid uses cookies to help Chameleoid identify and track
visitors, their usage of Chameleoid website, and their website access
preferences. Chameleoid visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their
computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Chameleoid's
websites, with the drawback that certain features of Chameleoid's websites may
not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Business Transfers
If Chameleoid, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the
unlikely event that Chameleoid goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user
information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a
third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any
acquirer of Chameleoid may continue to use your personal information as set
forth in this policy.

### Ads
Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising
partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize
your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile
information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows
ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they
believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of
cookies by Chameleoid and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

### Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Chameleoid may change its Privacy
Policy from time to time, and in Chameleoid's sole discretion. Chameleoid
encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy
Policy. Your continued use of our sites after any change in this Privacy Policy
will constitute your acceptance of such change.
